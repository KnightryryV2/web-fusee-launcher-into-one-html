# Description
This is a fork of [web-fusee-launcher](https://github.com/noirscape/web-fusee-launcher) by noirscape which is a fork of [web-fusee-launcher](https://github.com/atlas44/web-fusee-launcher), which is also a port of [fusee-launcher](https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher) to JavaScript using WebUSB. This has been mildly tested and appears to work on Linux, Android (unrooted), OSX and ChromeOS. Today, this only works on Chrome because only Chrome implements WebUSB. It also does NOT work on Windows because the WebUSB Windows implementation does not allow sending the required USB packet. The downloaded version is very not tested and may not even work. All I did was move all the JS scripts to the HTML file
