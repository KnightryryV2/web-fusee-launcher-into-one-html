# web-fusee-launcher
Fusee Launcher, in a browser!

# Description
This is a fork of [web-fusee-launcher](https://github.com/atlas44/web-fusee-launcher), which is a port of [fusee-launcher](https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher) to JavaScript using WebUSB. This has been mildly tested and appears to work on Linux, Android (unrooted), OSX and ChromeOS. Today, this only works on Chrome because only Chrome implements WebUSB. It also does NOT work on Windows because the WebUSB Windows implementation does not allow sending the required USB packet.
